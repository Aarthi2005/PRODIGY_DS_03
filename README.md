**Task Overview**

Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. 
Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Dataset Description**

The Bank Marketing dataset contains information about marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution, including various attributes such as age, job, marital status, education, and previous marketing interactions. 
The target variable ('y') indicates whether the customer made a purchase.

**Output**

The script generates output displaying the accuracy and classification report of the decision tree classifier, providing insights into its performance in predicting customer purchases based on demographic and behavioral data.

**Knowledge Gained**

The project provided insights into building a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchase behavior based on demographic and behavioral data from the Bank Marketing dataset. Key knowledge gained includes:

1.Understanding how to preprocess and handle real-world datasets, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting data for training and testing.

2.Familiarity with scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier for building decision tree models and tuning hyperparameters such as maximum depth.

3.Experience in evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy and classification report, enabling assessment of the classifier's predictive capabilities.

4.Application of machine learning techniques to solve practical business problems, such as predicting customer behavior in marketing campaigns.
